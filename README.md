## ü§î What is this?

The Family Meeting Hub is a single-page web application that acts as a digital guide for your weekly family check-ins. It eliminates the "what should we talk about?" problem by providing a series of interactive cards with randomized prompts. Whether you want to share highs and lows, learn a new skill, or just have a good laugh, this tool provides the spark.

It's built with simplicity in mind: no logins, no ads, no data collection. Just a clean, beautiful interface that works on any device with a web browser.
